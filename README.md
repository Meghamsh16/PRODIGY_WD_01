Features

Responsive Design: The website adapts to different screen sizes and devices, providing an optimal viewing experience on desktops, tablets, and mobile phones, Interactive Navigation Menu: A fixed-position navigation menu that changes color or style when scrolled or when hovering over a menu item and Smooth Transitions: Use of CSS transitions for smooth changes in styles and effects.
